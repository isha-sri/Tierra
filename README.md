# Tierra
Production of waste materials is increasing everyday. This waste can be recycled and upcycled but there is no appropriate way in which we can ensure that our waste is put to better use. If we are able to address the issue of waste management by connecting people who find such products useful in one way or the other, we can build a more sustainable environment.

## Short description

### What are we building?

Tierra is a portal for small businesses to connect with raw material providers and customers to upcycle as much materials as one can. Think of an invitation card vendor and a small business that makes handmade gifts. Now, think of a dress maker who has leftover cloth pieces that have no use. Now, there are small businesses who make beautiful hair bands out of torn clothes. A cherry on top is that some of them add a small zipper in the hair band which creates a place to keep money and other small things. Think of how many zippers from broken/torn purses can be put to use! All of these were just a few examples. Another initiative to recycle materials is thrifting, which means that people can sell items they no longer need. The platform will also accommodate thrifting solutions for people who are willing to buy reusable stuff in a good condition.

### What problems are we solving?

The idea focusses on the part where even a common man can make a difference by including sustainability in their day to day lives. It will not just help in sustaining nature but, it will also give small scale businesses a platform that appreciates their efforts and helps them rise. When people shop an upcycled product, they prevent extra manufacturing. When people create an upcycled product, they put our resources to better use. When they do this regularly, they bring a change.

### Why does it matter?

We believe that nature preservation isnâ€™t limited to curbing pollution and minimizing global warming. Even the most ordinary efforts can contribute towards building a more sustainable Earth and our solution is proof of it. Tierra is a platform that will help Making sustainability a habit by encouraging upcycling and building a more beautiful Earth

1. The seller navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. The user selects and buys the raw material of his/her choice
3. Tierra contacts delivery services and ensures safe and hurdle free delivery.
4. Both User and Seller can track the product until it gets delivered.

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.

- Buyer can buy product of its choice, and add the product to the cart do the payment and buy product.
- Seller can add products of his choice, and keep it for sale.
- Database in connected to the website using cloudant and cloud foundry. Auth feature is added to the website to maintain authenticity.

The website is almost functional with a few logistically critical features to be added like a payment gateway and a delivery service provider. We also need to create an organizational and financial structure once we decide to launch it. We intend to launch a beta version first to gather the responses and remove any issues that might arise. 

See below for our proposed schedule on next steps after Call for Code 2021 submission.
